## I lost my six figure job 3 months ago.

My daughter was 1.5 years old at the time, my wife was due in March for our second
child, and she hadn't worked in over a year. Some problems with our house had wiped out most of what savings we had, so despite my high salary,
we were living paycheck to paycheck. To make things even better, I was fired only a few weeks before my employee stock options would vest, adding even
more salt to the wound. I had been working 14-16 hour days for months pushing towards the company's goals. I kept telling myself it was worth it
because of those sizeable stock options. I even worked 12 hour days through having COVID the week before I was fired. I am definitely not still bitter at all.

_Things were looking a little rough._

Luckily, even though I was let go, I still hit all of my Q4 performance requirements so I received a sizeable bonus that gave us about 30 days of a runway
to figure out our future. 103 days later, I am extremely happy to report that we are good. I rebuilt my 6 figure salary through my own businesses, but
the current amount of risk is extremely high and this phase is temporary.

Now I need to focus on building a sustainable future for my family, and start thinking over the long term. If you want to read about my immediate first steps to get here, [I wrote about it](/blog/i-lost-my-job-what-now). I want to warn you though, it is not a get rich quick
plan. It is more of a recap of what worked for me. I have been thinking about what it is that I actually want to do with my life. I have
been working for other people since I was 15. I am currently 32. For a decade I have dreamed of quitting my day job and working on my own thing. I have
been a habitual side hustle, business starter, and bootstrapper.

Now that I suddenly, forcibly, found myself with my own business and side hustles as my only source of income, my dream had come true.

## My Dreams Had Come True.

_What happens now? How do I keep the dream alive? What even is the dream?_

This vague idea I had about what I wanted from my life, a foggy image of
the future. Now that I could do anything, I realized I had to sit down and figure out what anything was. Otherwise I would just drift through day to day
not building anything meaningful, and eventually both my head and bank account would be in a very bad spot. I kept circling back to various projects and
side hustles I had started over the years as well as the things that I have always wanted to do. The wish list to do list items that I never got around to.
I spent over a week just lost in thinking about the possibilities. It was debilitating and I realized that I was on the path to ruin.

Yesterday, I gave myself some time to think about what I really wanted from life, what I needed to provide for my family, and what I actually wanted to be
doing everyday. I didn't judge myself, I did not try to refine the list I just wrote a bullet point list of the things, experiences, and work I want to be doing.

I took that list and broke it into time frames. I originally did not plan on sharing it the important thing here is to be honest with yourself, what do you
really want from life and how do you want to achieve it. For me this was a mix of business, fun, and health goals.

### Right Now

This is my dream. At the end of the day I want to live on a small farm with a house my wife loves and bounce between my book shop, my workshop, and my game store.
I grew up at my local game store and I have been a nerd my whole life. Tabletop gaming has been a huge part of my life and who I am. I want to make something to contribute
to the community that I have received so much from. I love working with my hands and I want to make things, grow thing, and help people do the same.

I looked at these goals and I broke them down into immediate things I can start working on right now that will propel me to my goal:

- Set up investment accounts and college funds for my children
- Migrate my 401k and start contributing to my IRA
- Create content
- Start a YouTube Channel
- Build multiple sources of revenue focused on plants, leatherworking, gaming, books and art.
- 1 Month Emergency Savings Fund
- Start Working out
- Refine everyway (my business) and start widescale outreach to gain more clients

Every single one of my goals over the next 10 years can be broken down into immediate actionable things I can do today. I could even further break these
tasks down, but that would be a waste of time and instead I am going to just start doing them.

I look back at this list and some of it seems ridiculous. "This dude just left a Fortune 100 company and wants to grow plants? He wants to own a game store, and have a farm? WTF"
Maybe it is ridiculous. It is definitely ridiculous, but many of these things I have wanted to do since I was a kid, and now at 32 they are still here in my head everyday.
I have been putting them all off, but now I think it is time to at least try it out and see where it takes me.

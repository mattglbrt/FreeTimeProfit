Today I made major progress on finishing this website, and I started thinking about what my end game goals were. I wrote about this in depth in [Goal Setting](/blog/goal-setting)

## April 25, 2022

After years of thinking about starting this, I finally started. I have thrown together this extremely basic website in next.js.
I have built a version of this website no less than 10 times and I have realized that the design of the website is no where near as
important as just getting the content out and getting started.

Lately I have myself stuck in analysis paralysis. I keep making plans, doing research, procrastinating. I have realized that I am
free to do anything, I just need to but in the work behind it. So today, I started building this website and more importantly I took
action to start some side hustles.

It is totally out of left field, but today I started propagating several house plants that I have owned for a few years. How is this related
to side hustling? I have wanted to start a retail plant store for about 4 years now. I have started and stopped the effort multiple times
over the years. By making these cuttings I will be able to propagate 4 different plants into over 20 more plants. This took about an hour
out of my day, did not generate revenue, and seems pretty weird - but it was action. I started. However small this effort was, it put me on
track to being closer to owning a retail plant store. That is what matters.

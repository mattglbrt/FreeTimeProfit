## May 01

## The start of a new month, and also time to start grinding out some businesses. Today we had several family things planned so I spent my available work time prepping for the month and getting organized. My final planning day before getting busy tomorrow.

## April 30

## Today I nearly finished up all the content for my personal website and I performed several hours worth of development on client projects.

## April 29

Today I spent the morning at the Chesapeake Master Gardeners Plant sale and acquired several plants that will be used to grow and eventually propagate for sale.
The other half of the day was spent on client development work.
